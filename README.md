# Fashion-MNIST-Neural-Networks-Project
Overview
In this project, you'll work with the Fashion-MNIST dataset to design and train two neural networks for image classification. The task is to classify each image into one of 10 possible output classes using:

A Fully Feedforward Neural Network (FFN).
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
You'll experiment with various hyperparameters and architectural decisions to optimize performance.

Dataset
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of grayscale images, each 28x28 pixels, representing different clothing items. It includes:

60,000 training images.
10,000 testing images.
10 classes, such as T-shirt, coat, bag, etc.
This dataset can serve as a direct replacement for the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. Read more about the dataset on its official repository.

Getting Started
Data is automatically downloaded within the script using PyTorch. You'll need to:

Preprocess the data as required for training.
Design and implement the two neural networks (FFN and CNN).
Files
The project includes the following files:

fashionmnist.py: Skeleton code for the overall training and evaluation pipeline.
ffn.py: Skeleton code for the feedforward neural network.
cnn.py: Skeleton code for the convolutional neural network.
Tasks
Complete the implementation of the FFN and CNN models in their respective files.
Train and evaluate both models using Fashion-MNIST.
Experiment with hyperparameters such as:
Number of layers.
Number of neurons per layer.
Convolutional kernel sizes and counts.
Learning rates, optimizers, and batch sizes.
Deliverables
A trained FFN and CNN achieving optimal performance.
Clear documentation of your experimental process and results.
Framework
PyTorch is required for this project. Ensure it is installed in your development environment.
